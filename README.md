# AirSimNeurIPS
My solution to Airsim Competition at NeuRIPS using Rapid Trajectory Plannind and MPC. 

See attached pdf for implementation details.

# Disclaimer
This was written for the AirSim NeuRIPS 2019 competition as a very fast prototype. It's shared here for people interested in a state of art implementation for drone racing in Python. All I did was combining a fast planner with a MPC controller, adding a python wrapper on top. 

The system is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with python 3.6 on a Ryzen 2700x CPU. Actual performance on your platform can strongly vary. 

# Structure of code
Within `Daniel` folder, the `planning.py` is inherited and slightly adapted from [Mark Mueller](https://github.com/markwmuller/RapidQuadrocopterTrajectories). `control.py` is an interface to the code generated **ACADO** implementation of the drone controller, inherited from [Davide Falanga](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_mpc). If I'm violating any license agreement here please let me know. Adapting the `mpc_control/codegen.sh` allows you to generate highly efficient C code and python wrapper from ACADO, differently from what is available in the repo. 

# Installation guideline.
## Simulation env
You need to install AirSim first following [instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim-NeurIPS2019-Drone-Racing), remember to generate settings as instructed, and get the finals environment. 

## Dependencies
Clone repo from [ACADO](https://github.com/acado/acado) and [rpg-mpc](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_mpc) at the same level at this repo. ACADO is used for codegen, and for now only the solver is taken from the rpg-mpc repository. You need to adapt the pathing in `mpc_control/codegen.sh` otherwise. 

Move the acado source file into the acado toolkit folder for code generation. (This is not elegant but a working solution):

`mv mpc_control/quadrotor_model_thrustrates.cpp ../../ACADOtoolkit/examples/code_generation/mpc_mhe/`

Now execute 
```
cd mpc_control
./codegen.sh
```
And you will create a python binding for the C generated MPC code. 

Then you should be able to run `python daniel.py --level_name 'Final_Tier_1'`. If you are lucky, you should be able to reach the goal within 55 seconds.
